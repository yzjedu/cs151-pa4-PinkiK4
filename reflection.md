I was supposed to learn how to work with files,putting files in lists, and manipulating files and lists.
Moreover, I was supposed to learn how to manipulate functions.

The steps I followed were to work through all the high level tasks, design functions to solve them, and run the functions in a main function.
The techniques I used in this program was file manipulating, creating files with different permissions, and input error checking.

My results matched what I expected to get after using different methods to solve high level tasks. I tried various test cases.



The challenge I faced the most was figuring out how to organize file data in the most optimal way.
I did overcome them, and I did this by referring to class notes.
